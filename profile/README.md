# Deutsche Model United Nations e.V.

Political action through political education - that is our goal at [Deutsche Model United Nations (DMUN) e.V.](https://dmun.de) We are a non-profit organisation made up of young adults who are passionate about international politics and the United Nations. We are active nationwide and internationally in the field of political youth education and youth empowerment. Founded in 2003 and accredited as a non-governmental organisation with special consultative status with the United Nations Economic and Social Council and UNDPI since 2012, we organise political simulations ([model united nations conferences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_United_Nations)) in which teenagers and young adults between the ages of 15 and 21 simulate a United Nations conference. We also work at international level to promote political youth education and the participation of young people in political processes.

Here, on our GitHub account, you can find open source software that we create to aid any part of the process of planning and carrying out our conferences. We also strive to make these tools and applications available for free for other model united nations conferences that are interested in modern solutions for their conference-management.

## MUNify

MUNify is a collection/suite of tools and applications designed to organize and run a [model united nations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_United_Nations) conference. Currently, the following applications and tools are being developed:

### CHASE

[MUNify CHASE](https://github.com/deutschemodelunitednations/munify-chase) (CHAiring SoftwarE) aims to simplify aspects like participant management, document organization, commitee sessions (including speakers lists, voting and attendance tracking) and communication at the actual conference.
The software has already been deployed and used on two of our conferences. It is still in a pretty early development stage, where the software only has some key features that work reliably. The Tech-Stack features Bun, React with Next.js, Elysia, Prisma and a Postgres Database.

### STOCK

[MUNify STOCK](https://github.com/deutschemodelunitednations/munify-stock) will be a custom tool that makes inventory management easier for the conferences. It will also feature a flag-inventory solution. The project is still in a very early planning stage.

## MUNity

[MUNity](https://github.com/deutschemodelunitednations/munity) is a legacy Software that was succeeded by MUNify CHASE and aimed to fullfill basically the same requirements. Developent has been discontinued.

## Masterplan-Slack

The [Masterplan-Slack](https://github.com/deutschemodelunitednations/masterplan-slack) script allows the conversion of masterplans for personell and tasks in a certain Google Sheets format into Slack messages that can be sent out to your team in a personalized calendar format. The Script will be integrated into the MUNify-Suite at some point. Planned features are also sending of emails and reformatting the messages.
